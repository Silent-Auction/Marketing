# Marketing

The Purpose of this app is to allow people to view, bid, or sell specific items in a virtual (online) environment.

This app allows for a chance to bid on numerous items in an attempt to "win" in the end.

This app targets two types of users:

1.  Sellers: Sellers can upload multiple images of an item with a detailed description and the initial bid for the item.

2.  Bidders: Bidders are able to view all the available items and place a bid on that item while the item is still active.

I used Color Hunt for my color pallette.

I used Google fonts for my font choices.

My site was deployed using Netlify. The link is https://bw-silent-auction.netlify.com/.
